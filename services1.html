                            <h4>Why Use Rope Access?</h4><br>
                            <p>
                            Rope Access is a safe, efficient and time saving method derived from recreational climbing and caving but modified to utilize a twin rope system for enhanced safety in industrial use. This makes it the access method of choice for our industry, thus eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming scaffolding.
                            </p>
                            <p>It has been a preferred method of access (ingress and egress) for our clients offshore over conventional scaffolding for some of the following reasons:
                                <br>
                                Easy and time efficient to set up (rigging and de-rigging)<br>
                                Lightweight and portable equipment<br>
                                Does not take up space<br>
                                Practicality in a number of applications<br>
                                Minimum operational team of two operatives (three when over water)
                            </p>
                            <h4>Highly Qualified Staff</h4><br>
                            <p>Our dedicated and highly skilled personnel have accumulated a vast wealth of experience in this field and through this, and our professional approach, our clients can be assured that they will get the job done efficiently, safely & properly.

                            A team of SMIC abseiling technicians can identify potential dropped object hazards throughout the rig….not just in the derrick. By physically tagging each fixture at height with a unique alphanumeric code, rigs can ensure that each item in the DROPS inventory has been inspected and accounted for.</p>
                        <p>   
                            A full photographic inventory and action items report are generated to ensure that risk has been assessed for each area on the rig. Most importantly, items that are considered high risk are repaired by the technician, after all, many items are inaccessible without rope access.</p>

                        <h1>Wire Rope NDT & Visual Insp.</h1><br>
                        <p>
                            Systematic Industrial Contractor (SMIC) is offering wire rope inspection services in Saudi Arabia. Our inspection team follows the tested and proven guidelines to conduct wire rope inspection. There are various types of wire rope damage types used in wire rope inspection guideline, including :<br>
        
                            Abrasion damage may occur when the rope contacts an abrasive medium or simply when it passes over the drum and sheaves.<br>
                            
                            Corrosion is very difficult to evaluate but is a more serious cause of degradation than abrasion. Usually signifying a lack of lubrication, corrosion will often occur internally before there is any visible external evidence on the rope’s surface.<br>
                            
                            Diameter reduction is a critical deterioration factor and can be caused by A lengthening of rope lay, Internal or external corrosion damage, Excessive abrasion of the outside wires, Inner wire failure, Loss of core diameter.<br>
                            
                            Crushing or flattening of the strands can be caused by a number of different factors. These problems usually occur on multilayer spooling conditions but can occur by simply using the wrong wire rope construction.<br>
                            
                            Shock loading (bird-caging) of the rope is another reason for replacement of the rope. Shock loading is caused by the sudden release of tension on the wire rope and its resultant rebound from being overloaded.<br>
                            
                            High stranding may occur for a number of reasons such as failure to properly seize the rope prior to installation or maintain seizing during wedge socket installation.<br>
                            
                            We offers both on-site and in-house wire rope inspection services as required by our clients across the Saudi Arabia.<br>
                            
                            Our wire rope inspection staff includes the qualified personnel to conduct the activities effectively. Our staff is well qualified and experienced for working in confined spaces, working at height and emergency procedures.

                        <h1>Proof Load Testing</h1><br>
                        
                        <p>
                            Systematic Industrial Contractor (SMIC) performs hundreds of initial load test on new and existing cranes each year. We routinely perform crane load tests on units from under 1 tonne to well over 100 ton capacity.<br>
        
                            We are providing crane load test inspection and certification for all kind of lifting equipment and as well as other lifting devices and attachments for offshore and onshore base as per the manufacturers recommendation and for new installation.<br>
        
                            Systematic Industrial Contractor (SMIC) performs all capacities of load testing, for mobile/overhead cranes and rigging equipment hoists, slings, and other lifting apparatuses. We bring our portable tests weights to your site, and can do it when and where it’s convenient for you.<br>
        
                            You should insure that your crane is load tested when first installed prior to placing into service and whenever the crane is altered (new or repair that affects a load bearing component.) Many crane companies do not include the initial inspection with load test in their new crane proposal, so make sure that you have that addressed when you buy a new crane or hoist. The initial load test documents must be retained for the life of the crane.<br>
        
                            We perform many Initial Crane Load Tests each year on existing equipment where the crane load test documentation was lost or the initial was never performed. When we perform a load test, you will receive a document that outlines the procedure and any deficiency conditions found. We also retain a copy of your crane load test document with the inspections available on our on-line Proactive Inspection Program.<br>

                            At the start of the planning scaffolding inspection process, we supply relevant information to the scaffold contractor to ensure an accurate and proper design process is followed.
                            All scaffolding must be erected, dismantled and altered in a safe manner. We achieve this by following the guidance provided by the NASC in document SG4 ‘Preventing falls in scaffolding’ for tube and fitting scaffolds or by following similar guidance provided by the manufacturers of system scaffolding.

                            We take responsibility to ensure that all scaffolding has been inspected following installation /  before first use at an interval of no more than every 7 days thereafter following any circumstances liable to jeopardize the safety of the installation.
